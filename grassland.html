                        Grasslands cover much of North America, most famously in
                        the form of the Great Plains. The Great Plains stretch
                        into multiple US States and Canandian Provinces,
                        including the states of North and South Dakota, Kansas,
                        Nebraska, Iowa, Oklahoma, and even Texas. Canadian
                        provinces featuring the Great Plains include Manitoba,
                        Saskatchewan, and Alberta. Non-Great Plains grasslands
                        can also be found in the Central Valley in California,
                        western coastlines of the Gulf of Mexico, various arid
                        parts of the Southwest, and certain areas in the Great
                        Basin. Grasslands as a whole are a major part of the
                        farming economy in the US as well given their flat
                        terrain and fertile soil. However, this extensive human
                        activity has caused issues for the grassland ecosystems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Humans have been tightly tied to grasslands for most of
                        their history. Those activities include burning,
                        livestock grazing, hunting, farming, and the development
                        of villages, towns, and cities. What do these activities
                        mean for the ecosystems of grasslands? Unfortunately, we
                        see many native species of grasslands are in decline,
                        both plant and animal species. Climate change is
                        expected to make these declines worse. Furthermore, the
                        distribution of various species is also expected to
                        change. This is due to the flat terrain of grasslands.
                        Their flatness makes them more vulnerable to these
                        changes as temperature, climate, and rainfall changes
                        can take place over much larger areas. That means that
                        animal species have to move much larger distances to
                        deal with changes to their ecosystem climate.
                        Furthermore, major species like Bison no longer occupy
                        the ranges they once did. This can further limit an
                        ecosystem's ability to deal with climate change.

                        So, what will happen to the different ranges of
                        grasslands we've mentioned so far? First, the Great
                        Plains will most likely expand to the north in Canada
                        while contracting in the south. Second, contracting in
                        the south is a common pattern for grasslands, and many
                        grasslands located in the southern areas of North
                        America are expected to shrink.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One interesting consequence of the increased carbon
                        dioxide in the atmosphere is that there is expected to
                        be an increase in the amount of plant biomass in the
                        grasslands. However, since there will not be an increase
                        in available nutrients, these plants are expected to be
                        more deificient in their micronutrient composition.
                        Higher temperatures are also expected to increase
                        mineralization and nitrogen deposition. This would lead
                        to a direct increase in plant productivity. However,
                        this would also drive a decrease in plant biodiversity
                        since the most productive plants will be able to
                        outcompete the others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To sum up, what will climate change do to grasslands?
                        Overall, ranges of various animals and plants will
                        shift, while ranges of grasslands will shrink in the
                        south. The amount of plant biomass will probably
                        increase, but the biodiversity of those plants will
                        shrink. Furthermore, the plants that are left will be
                        depleted in micronutrients compared to earlier years.

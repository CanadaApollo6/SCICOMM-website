                    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                    <h2>What is SCICOMM?</h2>
                    <p>
                        SCICOMM is a final project given to undergraduate
                        biology students enrolled in Environmental Ecology at
                        the University of Dayton. It is assigned at the
                        beginning of the semester and due at the end.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What does SCICOMM stand for or mean?</h2>
                    <p>
                        SCICOMM is an abbreviation of two words: Scientific
                        Communication.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What is the goal of SCICOMM?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The goal of SCICOMM is to take complex but important
                        scientific topics and explain them to a more general
                        audience. It also serves as a way for the involved
                        students to learn how to better communicate their own
                        scientific knowledge to those without the same
                        background as them.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Is every SCICOMM project featured on this site?</h2>
                    <p>
                        No. Every student who has work featured here voluntarily
                        did so. While there are more students and more projects,
                        many chose their own ways to get their work into the
                        world. This was just one option for students to use.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What were the requirements for the projects?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The projects were very open-ended for students. They
                        were allowed to take on any topic, medium, and audience.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Is this website a SCICOMM project?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes! This website, along with the first 6 "projects" on
                        the home page, act as a single project. The idea to add
                        other projects to the site came later.
                    </p>
                    <h2>How was this website made?</h2>
                    <p>
                        While I originally thought about making this site a
                        ReactJS application, I realized that that would be
                        overkill for a site that only needed to display
                        information only. Instead, the base design of this site
                        uses a free template from
                        <a href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a>, and is just
                        HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I modified and added in all
                        of these areas as needed.

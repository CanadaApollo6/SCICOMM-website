                        The Arctic Circle has been the focus of much climate
                        change research, as it often sees the most dramatic
                        effects. That being said, it is important to understand
                        exactly what those effects are. Perhaps the first effect
                        to examine would be temperature. In the Arctic, the
                        average surface air temperature in 2019 was the second
                        highest it's ever been since 1900 (119 years ago!).
                        Knowing that, what does this rise in Arctic temperatures
                        mean?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Greenland Ice Sheet, among the largest in the world,
                        is now losing 267 billion metric tons of ice... per
                        year! Furthermore, sea ice thickness is decreasing year
                        after year. This makes that ice more and more vulnerable
                        to melting. This loss of ice contributes a measurable
                        amount to sea level rise in the form of 0.7mm of sea
                        level rise per year. Sea level rise can of course
                        contribute to increased flooding and more extreme storms
                        around the world, meaning that ice melting in the Arctic
                        affects all of us. Meanwhile, snow cover in June of 2019
                        was the third lowest of the past 53 Junes. Of course,
                        changes in the Arctic most directly affect the people
                        who live there.

                        Fisheries in the Bering and Barents Seas have seen
                        northern shifts in the species that they fish for. This
                        makes it harder and harder each year for the communities
                        that operate those fisheries to have access to those
                        fish. Elders in those communites said to NOAA, "[i]n a
                        warming Arctic, access to our subsistence foods is
                        shrinking and becoming more hazardous to hunt and fish.
                        At the same time, thawing permafrost and more frequent
                        and higher storm surges increasingly threaten our homes,
                        schools, airports, and utilities."

                    <p>
                        The thawing permafrost mentioned in that quote is more
                        important to the rest of the world than you might think.
                        Permafrost traps greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide
                        and methane, and the melting of permafrost can release
                        those gases. In fact, melting permafrost is releasing
                        300-600 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere each
                        year. Increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of
                        course means even warmer temperatures, which melts more
                        permafrost, and a positive feedback loop is formed.

                        All these changes have strong effetcs on Arctic
                        wildlife. While polar bears have seen a dramatic and
                        publicized decline, other creatures are seeing similar
                        problems. One great example of this is the ivory gull.
                        The ivory gull, a bird that lives in the Canadian
                        Arctic, has seen a 70% decline in its breeding
                        population since the 1980s.

                        So what does climate change mean for the Arctic? It
                        means melting sea ice, thawing permafrost, damage to
                        communities, and rising sea levels around the world.
                        Changes in the Arctic can and will affect us all.

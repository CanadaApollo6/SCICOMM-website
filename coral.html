                        Perhaps the most famous term when talking about the risk
                        of climate change to coral reefs is coral bleaching.
                        However, what is coral bleaching? Corals actually live
                        in a symbiotic relationship with a microscopic organism
                        that provides them much of their energy, colour, and
                        nutrients. When the oceans get too warm, the corals can
                        get figuratively "stressed out", causing them to expel
                        those microscopic organisms. That causes them to lose
                        their colour, creating the famous photos of white corals
                        that can be found in National Geographic and other
                        similar magazines. While corals can recover from this
                        process if conditions return to a closer level to
                        normal, many corals often permanently die.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bleaching is not the only effect that climate change is
                        having on coral reefs. The stress from that increased
                        sea temperature can also make corals more vulnerable to
                        infectious disease outbreaks. Meanwhile, rises in sea
                        level also cause a corresponding rise in sea floor
                        sediment levels. In shallow reefs this can cause corals
                        to be smothered or even buried by sediments.
                        Furthermore, climate change is leading to an increase in
                        storms like hurricanes. These increased storms can
                        simply destroy corals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another commonly talked about term is ocean
                        acidification. This process is a direct result of the
                        increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dissolving
                        into the ocean, creating carbonic acid. What does this
                        change in pH (acid levels) do to the corals?
                        Unfortunately, this change leads to both decreased
                        growth rates and a decrease in structural integrity for
                        the corals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So what does climate change mean for coral reefs?
                        Unfortunately, nothing good. Both increased bleaching
                        events and increased disease outbreaks are already being
                        seen. Increased numbers of extreme storms will cause
                        more physical destruction of corals. Rising sea levels
                        mean many shallow corals could be smothered or buried by
                        rising sediment, and changes in ocean pH mean slower
                        growing corals that are structurally weaker.
